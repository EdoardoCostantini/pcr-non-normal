# Description -------------------------------------------------------------

  # Given a data set A in matrix for, it extracts the first keep principal
  # components from A, and returns a dataset
  # with the first column of A cobined with the extracted components.
  # It also retunrs the info regarding the proportion of explained variance
  # by the defined number of components
  # when @cor_tupe = "mixed", psych::principal recognizes which variables
  # need pearson, polyserial, polychoric, tetrachoric correlations

# Internals ---------------------------------------------------------------

  # dt = dat_disc # MASS::mvrnorm(1e2, rep(0, 3), diag(3))
  # keep = c("naf", "nkaiser", ".8", "3")[2] # how should we decide what pcs to keep?
